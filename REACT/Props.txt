=====[REACT PROPS]==============================================================

- PROPS => PROPERTIES

- IN REACT APPLICATIONS, DATA IS PASSED FROM 
PARENT COMPONENTS TO CHILD COMPONENTS USING PROPS

- IF A FUNCTION IS PASSED TO THE CHILD COMPONENT, 
IT CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE STATE OF THE PARENT 
COMPONENT FROM THE CHILD COMPONENT

<Counter setCount={setCount} />


- THE SETCOUNT PROP CAN NOW BE CALLED IN THE 
COUNTER COMPONENT TO UPDATE THE COUNT STATE 
VARIABLE IN THE PARENT COMPONENT

const Component = ({ setCount }) => {
    _________________

    setCount(count + 1);
    _________________
}

- THE CONTEXT API AND REDUX ARE MORE ADVANCED 
WAYS OF MANAGING DATA IN REACT APPLICATIONS
