=====[MVC ARCHITECTURE]=======================================================

- MODELS => HANDLES DATA LOGIC
- VIEWS => HANDLES DATA PRESENTATION
- CONTROLLERS => HANDLES REQUEST FLOW

- AXIOS CAN BE USED TO SEND HTTP REQUESTS FROM 
REACT ON THE CLIENT-SIDE TO EXPRESS-ROUTER ON 
THE SERVER-SIDE

- EXPRESS ROUTER WILL NAVIGATE ALL REQUESTS 
FROM REACT ON THE CLIENT-SIDE TO THE 
CONTROLLERS IN EXPRESS


===[CONTROLLERS]=======================================================

- THE CONTROLLER WILL EVALUATE AND HANDLE ALL OF 
THE REQUESTS PROVIDED BY THE ROUTER

- DEPENDING ON THE REQUEST, THE APPROPRIATE 
CONTROLLER FUNCTION WILL BE EXECUTED AND 
A RESPONSE WILL BE SENT TO REACT ON THE 
CLIENT-SIDE

- THE CONTROLLER SEARCHES FOR THE MODEL THAT 
CONTAINS THE REQUESTED DATA AND THEN THE MODEL 
INTERACTS WITH THE DATABASE. 

- ONCE THE MODEL RESPONDS TO THE CONTROLLER 
WITH THE REQUESTED DATA, THE CONTROLLER MUST 
COMMUNICATE WITH THE VIEW TO RENDER THE DATA 
IN HTML WHICH THE BROWSER CAN INTERPRET.

- THE VIEW THEN RETURNS THE WEBPAGE TO THE 
CONTROLLER WHICH SENDS IT TO THE CLIENT'S 
BROWSER AS A RESPONSE TO THE REQUEST
