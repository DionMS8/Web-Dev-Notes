=====[COOKIES AND SESSION IDS]=======================================

- THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO AUTHORIZING USERS 

=> THE CLIENT PERFORMS AN HTTP POST REQUEST
TO SUBMIT THEIR CREDENTIALS AND LOGIN

=> THE SERVER STORES THE USER IN ITS SESSION 
MEMORY

=> THE SERVER SENDS A SESSION ID TO THE CLIENT'S 
BROWSER AS A COOKIE

=> WHENEVER THE CLIENT SENDS A REQUEST, IT WILL 
BE SENT WITH THE SESSION ID COOKIE

=> THE SERVER WILL CHECK IT'S SESSION MEMORY AND 
FIND THE USER ASSOCIATED WITH THE SESSION ID IN 
THE COOKIE AND VERIFY THEM
