=====[JWTS]=======================================================

- JWT => JSON WEB TOKEN 
- JWS => JSON WEB SIGNATURE
- JWE => JSON WEB ENCRYPTION

- JWTS ARE USED FOR AUTHORIZATION
- THE NEW APPROACH TO AUTHORIZING USERS 

===[HOW IT WORKS]====================================================

=> THE CLIENT PERFORMS AN HTTP POST REQUEST
TO SUBMIT THEIR CREDENTIALS AND LOGIN

=> THE SERVER CREATES A JWT FOR THE USER AND 
SIGNS IT WITH A SECRET KEY, THEN SENDS THE JWT 
TO THE CLIENT'S BROWSER

=> WHENEVER THE CLIENT SENDS A SUBSEQUENT 
REQUEST, IT WILL BE SENT WITH THE JWT WHICH WILL
PROVIDE THE SERVER WITH THE PAYLOAD THAT 
REPRESENTS THE USER'S INFORMATION

=> THE SERVER WILL VERIFY THE SECRET JWT 
SIGNATURE (KEY) AND GET THE USER FROM THE JWT

=> THE SERVER WILL THEN SEND A RESPONSE TO 
THE CLIENT'S BROWSER


===[JWTS VS SESSION ID TOKENS IN COOKIES]================================

=> WITH JWTS, NOTHING IS STORED ON THE SERVER
WHICH IS BETTER SINCE IT MEANS THE TOKENS CAN 
BE SENT ANYWHERE ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVERS 
WITHOUT ANY ERRORS

=> SESSION ID TOKENS REFER TO A STATE ON THE 
SERVER WHILE JWTS CONTAIN THE ACTUAL INFORMATION 
NEEDED FOR AUTHORIZATION

=> BOTH CAN BE EXCHANGED AS COOKIES
