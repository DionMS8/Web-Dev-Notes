===== MONGOOSE ============================================================

- MONGOOSE IS A MONGODB OBJECT MODELING TOOL 
- IT IS A NODE MODULE
- IT IS DESIGNED FOR USE IN AN ASYNCHRONOUS ENVIRONMENT

- MONGOOSE PERFORMS QUERIES TO THE MONGODB DATABASE
- THESE QUERIES ARE SENT TO THE DATABASE ENGINE WHICH LOCATES THE DESIRED DATA
- THE DATABASE ENGINE RETURNS THE DATA TO MONGOOSE
- MONGOOSE THEN RETURNS THE DATA TO THE CALLING FUNCTION



=== CLUSTERS

- THE CLUSTER IS A SMALL SERVER WHICH WILL MANAGE THE COLLECTIONS OF DATA

=== CONNECTING THE BACKEND TO THE CLUSTER

1. CREATE A SERVER.JS FILER IN THE BACKEND FOLDER
2. CREATE A DATABASE.JS FILE AND ENTER:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const connection = "mongodb+srv://username:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";
mongoose.connect(connection,{ useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useFindAndModify: false})
    .then(() => console.log("Database Connected Successfully"))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));

3. ENTER MONGODB USERNAME, CLUSTER PASSWORD, CLUSTER ADDRESS, AND NAME OF DATABASE
