===== MONGOOSE ============================================================

=== NOTES

- MONGOOSE IS A MONGODB OBJECT MODELING TOOL 
- DESIGNED FOR USE IN AN ASYNCHRONOUS ENVIRONMENT

- MONGOOSE IS USED TO DEFINE SCHEMAS AND MODELS FOR THE MONGODB DATABASE

- IT PERFORMS QUERIES TO THE MONGODB DATABASE
- IT ACCESSES THE MONGODB THROUGH THE MONGO DRIVER
- THESE QUERIES ARE SENT TO THE DATABASE ENGINE WHICH LOCATES THE DESIRED DATA
- THE DATABASE ENGINE RETURNS THE RELEVANT DATA TO MONGOOSE
- MONGOOSE THEN RETURNS THE DATA TO THE CALLING FUNCTION


=== INSTALLATION

npm i mongoose


npm i --save-dev nodemon

- NODEMON WILL AUTOMATICALLY REFRESH THE SCRIPT 
FILE WHENEVER CHANGES ARE MADE WITHOUT HAVING
TO RUN/RESTART THE SCRIPT

ADD TO PACKAGE.JSON => "devStart": "nodemon script.js"

npm run devStart


- The problem that Mongoose aims to solve is 
allowing developers to enforce a specific schema 
at the application layer.
