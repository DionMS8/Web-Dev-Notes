=====[NEXT.JS]=========================================================

- IT IS A FRAMEWORK THAT IMPROVES REACT APPS 


===[DATA FETCHING]========================================================

- IT ALLOWS FOR VARIOUS DATA FETCHING TECHNIQUES 
TO BE USED TOGETHER FOR AN APPLICATION

STATIC GENERATION => ALL PAGES ARE RENDERED AT 
BUILD TIME

export async function getStaticProps() 


SERVER-SIDE RENDERING => EACH PAGE IS RENDERED 
ON THE SERVER AND GENERATED EACH TIME IT IS 
REQUESTED BY THE USER   

export async function getServerSideProps() 

- THIS ENSURES THAT THE MOST UPDATED DATA ON 
THE SERVER IS BEING GENERATED AT REQUEST TIME

- APPROPRIATE FOR PAGES WITH VERY DYNAMIC DATA


INCREMENTAL STATIC REGENRATION => RE-GENERATES SINGLE
PAGES IN THE BACKGROUND
